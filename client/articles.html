                        <h4 class="hs_theme_color">  COLD TO CANCER… FOLLOW THE ‘SIMILAR’ RULE.</h4>
                        <p>Especially for the beginners, a word of caution - Do not be carried away by the diagnosis, whatever the disease may be, follow the rule of ‘Similia Similibus Curenter’ and it will lead to cure of the patient. Here, I would like to share my experience with you which gives courage of conviction to aforesaid statement.</p>
                        <p> A female aged about 55 years complains of pain on swallowing, difficult speech with hoarseness of voice. She used to have frequent colds, very sensitive to cold air. On examination-hard indurated swelling on the right side of palate. Diagnosed as ‘Squamous Cell Carcinoma’ of palate. Treatment : as there is no characteristic symptom we started the case with Aur. Ars. 200 1d right sided Cancerous induration aggravation on touch with loathing of life and Hydrastis Q (Cancer Palate (KR 398) – Aur, Hydr) which gave little relief in spite of varieties of potencies.</p>
                        <p>For acute colds I used to prescribe M.I.F. which used to give here little relief. To eradicate the sensitiveness I thought of giving Hep. Sulph. 200 1d which also has a sensation of splinter and as it is also a right sided remedy. After Hepar the hard swelling started disappearing and an ulcer of the cervical gland appeared which drained the cancerous matter along with pus & blood. The growth started reducing in size, restoring voice and painless deglutition.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of the appearance of an ulcer of the gland, punched out edges I prescribed Kali bich 200 1d which gave great relief to the patient.</p>
                        <p>  Thus Hepar.sulph which is mostly thought of usually in acute cases simply because of the similarity it led the case in a curative direction.</p>

                      <p>Most of the people and young Homoeopathic physicians fear that Homoeopathy acts very slowly in acute cases like fever etc., thus it can not relieve quickly. So as, many physicians advise to take allopathy Rx along the Homoeo treatment.</p>
                      <p>But my experience teaches me and that’s what I want to share with you is, it is more easy to treat the acute cases than chronic as in acute cases, you have the remedy in front of you and you have to just identify it. Where as, in chronic cases you have to choose the very similar remedy among the indicated medicines.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>A 40 years male came complaining high fever associated with vomitings since 2 days; Temp. 102 F; Chill +, wants to cover. He wants to strain his mind with his occupation which is giving him much relief. I am just thinking about the routine prescription like Ars. Alb or any seasonal remedies enquired about his vomitings. He said it is after mid night; better after eating. It strike a bit unusual so as gone through Kent Rep where I could find the only remedy Ferr.met. I gave him the same remedy 1 dose in 200 potency within 12 hours, the temperature came down to normal and no vomitings. He even did not have the weakness after such a high fever for two days. Later, when I analyze the case I found the other symptoms like fever better by mental exertion which I totally neglected; vomitings after mid night also indicating only to the Ferr.met.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>I conclude saying Homoeopathy acts acutely in all the cases if the indicated remedy is given. So, the failure of acute cases is the failure of the homoeopathic physician but not the Homoeopathic Medicine or the Homoeopathic system.</p>

                      <h4 class="hs_theme_color">APPROACH TO THE CASE – ACCORDING TO THE CASE.</h4>
                      <p>There is no iron clad rule in approaching to the case in any medical system. As most of the people deal with approach towards taking the case, I would like to deal with the prescription part of approaching the case. As such it is a vast subject to discuss I would like to make it very brief with ease to understand along with my experience.</p>
                      <p>After taking the case thoroughly as it includes present symptoms, past history, family history, the stage comes to the physician to prescribe. The physician should decide his path towards curing the case. To make it brief it all depends on the present expression of the disease.</p>
                      <p>i)If the present symptoms are leading to particular remedy basing on <b><u>peculiar / characteristic symptoms</u></b> or physical and mental generals along with particulars you can give the remedy and you will definitely find the good results.
                      35 Years female C/o joint pains of 2 years duration worse during rest, evening; better by walking. She feels more worse after bathing, during rainy season and cold weather. Better by warmth covering. Basing on the above symptoms I prescribed RT 200 1d she relieved within 4 days. It looks like a cooked up case but we do get cases with this kind of description and this kind of cases are very easy to treat.</p>
                      <p>ii)During the course of study we do here a lot from our seniors ‘Struck at the cause – Root out the disease’. If you know <b><u>the causative factor</u></b> it is very easy to treat but the difficulty comes to find out the causative factor. It doesn’t mean that patient did not reveal he may ignore/neglect it. And at times there looks so many causative factors but it is the analyzing power of the physician to find out the cause</p>
                      <h6>Here, I would like to share my few experiences : </h6>
                      <p>
                         A) A male around 40 years old came with multiple recurrent ulcers and one chronic big with 9 cm x 5cm x 3cm                  depth over his left foot since 20 years there is swelling and severe burning. Unable to walk. Slight sticky                  watery fluid oozes out. On further questioning he said the similar complaint to his father. According to him it                  started after an injury with a wood to his both legs, he says it is not the cause for it as right leg is absolutely                  fine. He works in a farm where he has to deal with chemicals.
                      </p>
                      <p>But I decided to give considering the injury as the causative factor Arnica 1M 1d – within 15 days lot of pus                  with offensive discharge which was not there in his 20 years but a general well being. I gave Saclac for                  another 15 days but a general well being. I gave Saclac for another 15 days. There is no another ulcer                  formation. The ulcer which was so big came to 9 cm x 3 cm x 0.5cm. still I have to wait for the progress of the disease.</p>
                      <p> B) A male aged 45 years c/o frequent throat infection, back pain and skin eruptions for the past 25 years. On                 routine enquiry, he told he had an accident to back 10 years back. Severe chicken-pox, Jaundice, Malaria in                 chronological order from his childhood. I gave him Variolinum 1M 1d attributing it as a causative factor – if you                 analyze the case and the prognosis of chicken-pox neuralgia, skin eruptions along with general malaise.</p>
                      <p>So the physician should know which is to be considered as the causative factor.</p>
                      <p>iii) Grossly speaking causative factor comes under <b><u>Past History</u></b> but the way you consider them is different. Many Junior doctors do get the doubt including myself, as I passed through that Period, how the past history helps to your prescription. Here again the caliber of the physician comes out.</p>
                      <p>
                      A lady, 35 c/o white discharge, ropy in nature no odour, no itching, no burning through out the month – pain in back and lower limbs since 3 years. She took Homoeopathy Rx for the 1.5 years which doesn’t relieve her. When I asked about her obstetric history, she said this problem started after the last delivery which is FTND. The first one was also FTND. On further asking she said during her last pregnancy she had an attack of mumps. There I decided to go on the basis of the past history which also effects the ovaries in it’s long run-gave her Parotidium 1M 1d. Within 15 days the discharge completely stopped. For the past 5 months she had no complains.</p>
                      <p>
                        iv)There are few cases on noting down each and every symptom we left ourselves in a confused state. At times there appears so many characteristic symptoms but each indicates to different medicine where we fail to choose the remedy. Some times there are so many symptoms but to prescribe there is not symptom. In such case we can base our first prescription on the <b><u>Previous treatment</b></u> just to antidote it which puzzled/spoiled/suppressed the actual disease picture.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        v)<b><u>Family history</b></u> also includes to know the miasmatic tendency. Young Homoeopaths doubt that every disease comes under three miasms them how to diagnos the tendency of miasm. In very few occasions we can diagnose the miasm on the basis of the name of the disease but in most of the cases we can do it only on the consequences of the disease. At times the nosodes helps a lot in overcoming the obstacles to cure at times ending the case in cure. Even after miasmatic diagnosis to give the miasmatic remedy you should keep the present evolved symptoms as we have got many miasmatic remedies.
                      </p>
                      <p>vi)<b><u>Time factor</b></u> is mostly neglected by many physicians. Even patient repeats again and again the very specific time of aggravation/amelioration they do not consider it. If they prescribe on the basis we can find astonishing results.</p>
                      <p>A Lady 44 Years c/o Numbness and cramps of alternate hands during mind night. Every night her sleep is disturbed due to that. I gave her syphillinum 200 1d which we find in SR under night aggravation. For the past 3 months she had no attack of the numbness and cramps.</p> 
                      <p>
                        Thus we should decide the case according the symptoms availability. At the same time we should not be carried by the diagnosis. If the symptoms are indicating even though we never thought of that remedy in those cases, we should prescribe the remedy and we’ll get the deserving results. In a case of haemorrhoids, when the patient complains of pain by slightest movement and better by rest I have given Bryonia 200 1d which we rarely think in such type of cases but the results are good. 
                      </p> 
                      <p>Though there is no specific rule to approach the every case BUT, there will be always specific indication to that particular case if you analyse the presenting symptom properly. If physicians do not fail to catch that indication, Homoeopathy can show ‘miracles’- in terms of non-homoeopathic people.</p>

                      <p class="text-center"><b>RAPID CURE WITH THE CAUSATION</b></p>
                      <p> Most of the people think that Homoeopathy is very slow in it's path towards   the cure. Truly, it is the highest ideal of cure as Hahnemann said in 2nd   Aphorism in  his organon i,e. it is rapid, gentle and permanent restoration of  health. But, in most of   the cases many young Homoeopaths need much time due to lack of the natural   expression of disease which was suppressed by so many means. They have to  overcome each suppression layer by layer just like peeling of onion  to restore  the patients health.</p>
                      <p>But, if they concentrate on the Causative factor, their treatment will take very less time as they are striking at the root of the disease.</p>
                      <p> I would like to share my experience which taught me the importance of  Causative factor.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>A female aged about 50 years came to my Clinic with complaint of burning   and itching of eyes with lachrymation. There is also bland nasal discharge since 1   year, she is known hypertensive since 8 years. Euphrasia  200 1d relieved her eye and nasal complaints. When I have to prescribe for her hypertension there was no symptom which can  lead to a similar remedy. So, I enquired about the past, which made her to check her blood pressure, she informed that 8 years back she had an injury to head  since then, her B.P. was 170/110 mm in  Hg.</p>
                      <p>Basing on the injury  to head and sensitiveness to damp weather I  prescribed Nat. Sulph. 1M 1d which reduced her B.P. to 130/80  mm of Hg within 10  days. For the last 2 months her B.P. was WNL and  she  had no complaints.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>What I conclude is, if there is any peculiar, striking characteristic symptom prescribe basing on that. If cases presented with few symptoms, one sided in nature   there, if you prescribe basing on the causative factors you will find the deserving results within  a Short Period.</p>

                      <p>The above information gave an enthusiastic idea to apply the Homoeopathic principle "Similia Similibus Curentur" and the results of Gossypium in impotency cases are encoura­ging. One case was totally recovered i.e. the sperm count has came into normal ranges.</p>
                      <p>So, I request my colleagues to thought of Gossypium in stubborn cases of impotency where no remedy is indicated and let all our world know about the results.</p>
                      <p>It is also giving me a new thought - impotency curing medicines can also be used for family planning? I think though Homoeopathy is according to natures law, I hope it can also act against the nature to protect the nature. If you don't feel it as unfit here, why don't we discuss & exchange opinions on family planning by Homoeopathy.</p>

                      <p>I would like to share my sweet experiences with small sugar pills which moved the confidence of patients that Homoeopathy acts slowly.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p> A lady, aged 43years c/o pain in small joints spl. that of fingers with hard nodules over and deformed joints. They are so stiff that she can not move the finger. It is not restricted but immovable. She feels as if she is handicapped. These complaints are gradual in origin and of 7 years duration. She is more worse with slightest change in weather, on waking from a sleep.  Left is more involved.  As soon as she entered in to my clinic she is going on talking on each and everything constantly. The only time she is comfortable with the pains is during menses, absolutely pain free. Now she fears as she is passing thro’ menopausal period so as she won’t have even that 5 days relief. She is sensitive to summer. Cold weather makes her little comfortable. She fears that her husband may left her. Some indescribable fear and anxiety for the past 6 months.</p>
                      <p> Basing on the present picture I prescribed Lachesis 200 1d and Saclac for 7 days. After a week she came with a miraculous movements of hands (in words of the patient) and shook my hand with happiness. The stiffness has been totally gone even the nodules size and texture also changed positi­vely. I kept on SL, she is improving week by week, yet to follow the case.</p>
                      <p>In another case of Gout the patient makes miraculous screaming movements of great toe with pricking pain asso­ciated with dysuria and worse in warm room, by movement. He is getting constantly dreams of mice since the complaint began. KR  1241   (Coloch, Mag.s, Sep)  I gave Colchicum 200 1d  and  he is comfortable within 10 days.</p>
                      <p>A male 55 years came complaining of pain in all joints started after radiation for a   tumor in right leg. Pros­tration is the only other associated feature. I gave Rad.brom 200 1d and he felt relieved with the pains as well as prostration.</p>
                      <p>When a similimum acts, as our seniors  say, acts in a wink of night and brings   out dramatic cures. So, whether it is Rheumatology or Haematology, concentrate in  finding the similimurn,  we’ll make ourselves satisfied and the patients more comfortable.</p>

                      <h4 class="hs_theme_color">MENSES – MINUTE DETAILS – MAXIMUM RESULTS </h4>
                      <p>In PMS even though there are ‘n’ number of problems most of the people approach the doctor if they have the pain what we call as Dysmenorrhoea. I want to share same of my experiences.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>1. A young lady, 24 years, has severe pain before the onset of the periods. The pain is so severe that she cannot move, moans with pain, giddy, faints, sweats like water drops. Pain is in spasms. Constant rubbing gives slight relief. I gave mag.mur 200 1d (pain abd. During menses rubbing back amel mag.mur KR) she did not get much relief when I enquired further she told  it is burning pain in hypogastrium. I gave her Nat. Mur 200 1d during the pain (burning pain abd. Hypogastric during menses KR) that gave her immediate relief. After that she had no pain before / during periods for the past 2 years.</p>
                      <p>2. A 18 years aged girl came complaining of fainting episodes along with the pain in abdomen. Associated with urge for stool and feels relieved if she can pass. Basing on that I gave Nux.Vom 200 1d, she relived of the pain within seconds. No further fainting episodes also.</p>
                      <p>3. A lady 46 years complains of depressive moods with great irritability, losing temper for small things. It started since 6 years and only before periods. Menses – Regular, 4-6 days, her usual flow. She also having white discharge mucus like, for 10 days mid of the cycle. Pap smear - no abnormality. Scan reports normal study. She informed that she will have the flow only after the pain (flow only after the pain-mag c KR). I gave Mag. Carb 200 1d since then neither depressive moods nor irritability and to my surprise no leucorrhoea. At times these minute observations help us in finding the constitutional remedies.</p>
                      <p>  If we taken the full details of menses most of the times the remedy will be within that. Perceiving the periods irrespective of the case may produce the similar remedy.</p>

                      <h4 class="hs_theme_color">PATHWAYS TO PERFECTION OF PRESCRIPTION </h4>
                      <p>True physician is he/she, who tries to prescribe in a perfect manner by searching, knowing and researching the ways thus become a perfect prescriber. To prescribe we need a well taken care which includes SOIL Symptoms (S-Subjective; O-objective; I-interrogative; L-lab investigative). We have to analyse the case with the available symptoms to decide the class of the disease according to the ‘clinical classification of diseases’ (of Hanneman) on which we can choose the method to prescribe.</p>
                      <p>
                        First, we deal with first one third of the prescription. The REMEDY. Our choosing of the remedy depends on the class of the case or basing on the peculiar, characteristic symptoms as you all know, I don’t want to repeat the same, but, other than those we also have some other methods to prescribe which gives more relief to the patient in a quicker period as required in a day to day practice.
                      </p>
                      <p>i) <b><u>Seasonal remedies</u></b>: The seasonal remedies always help to treat the case very quickly, either they cure it completely or they make a path for the indicated remedy</p>
                      <p>i) <b><u>Causative Factors</u></b>: Irrespective of the presenting symptoms if we prescribe basing on the sure causative factors the results will be of miracles in a non-homoeopathic peoples view.</p>
                      <p>i) <b><u>Family history</u></b>:  Basing on the family history, we prescribe the miasmatic remedy which at least makes the case 50% clear within a short period. </p>
                      <p>i) <b><u>Nosodes</u></b>: The knowledge of the usage of nosodes is very essential. Many times the nosode itself completes the case with the first prescription only.</p>
                      <p>i) <b><u>Organ remedies</u></b>: Certain remedies have profound affinity wards the specific organs. These include few Sarcodes too. They help to begin the case with great satisfaction of the patient.</p>
                      <p>I suggest to go for a single remedy instead of poly pharmacy as it helps for the ‘Second prescription’ as well as to the further analysis of the case. But what ever the mode of the prescription, you follow ‘the Similia Similibus Curentur’ irrespective of the disease, we land with good results.</p>
                      <p>Coming to the second one third of the prescription – POTENCY. Most of the physicians say always start with low potencies then go to the high potencies. Though, we cannot say which potency is low and high as it varies according the case, for our convenience we decide 30 or below 30 – low potencies; 1M or above 1M – High potencies. As per my experience if the remedy is ‘similium’ we can prescribe in a so called high potency, i.e. start with 1M. If the remedy is similar we can start with 200 and according to the progress we change the potency. If there are many structural changes we have to go for low potencies and at times may have to repeat more frequently . In rainy season we get more medicinal aggravation with the required potency too.</p>
                      <p>Last but not the least, the third part of the prescription DOSAGE. It is also depends on how the case is presented If the exciting cause is present we have to repeat. If the remedy is a similimum single dose is sufficient to terminate the case. In rainy season we require more repetitions.</p>
                      <p>
                       Whatever the method of the prescription, only aim of the physician is to cure the patient. As Homoeopathy, the way for the goal varies according the physician but it should serve in a Homoeopathic way i.e. rapid, gentle and permanent.</p>
